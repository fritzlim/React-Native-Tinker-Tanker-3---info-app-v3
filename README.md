# React-Native-Tinker-Tanker-3---info-app-v3


This uses the React Native Paper library for the Home and Contact screens.

The Home page uses Stack navigation, so that there's a title bar (and the screen contents aren't obstructed by the device's front camera nor notch).

The list on the Contact screen is clickable, and will show a details page.
